**Maroon Chief Jacko in 1812

2014 marked the 200th anniversary of the death of Jacko, a maroon chief who lived a free man in the forests of Dominica for upwards of 40 years. He was once enslaved on Beaubois Estate.

The period from about 1802 to 1815 has been identified as the Second Maroon War in Dominica’s history. During that period about 800 maroons lived in various camps in the interior of the island. Their numbers were increasing due to influx of black persons escaping from slavery. Their existence and survival was an incentive for enslaved Africans to escape to freedom; but also seen as a threat to the slave holders. Various legislations were introduced in parliament to eliminate the maroons. These included an Act ‘to establish a company of rangers for the apprehending and suppressing of runaway slaves…” in 1793; an Act “for the trial and punishment of captured chiefs or leaders of camps” in 1800; and an Act ‘”or banishing of slaves held in jail” in 1800.

George Robert Ainslie was appointed Governor of Dominica on June 1, 1812. He escalated the war against the Maroons and his methods were so atrocious that he was recalled to England, by the Secretary of State in June 1814, to explain a proclamation made by him on the 3rd of October 1813 for exterminating the maroons. In the period between May 1813 and November 1814 about 600 Africans were killed in battle, executed, captured, imprisoned, died in jail, re-enslaved, sold into slavery, or banished.

Among those who died in battle in 1814 were Chiefs Elephant, Moco George, and Gabriel. The ageing Chief Quashi was banished in January 1815.

Of significance during that period was the death of the elder Chief Jacko on July 12th 1814. Jacko was killed in a fierce battle which took place at Jacko’s Camp in the upper Layou valley.

Today, various sites in the Upper Layou Valley bear the names associated with our maroon history: Mòn Neg Mawon, Vout Sawa, Mòn Jacko, Banbou Étò, Plat Jacko, Fon Zonbi, Basen Wil, Jacko Steps, and the various Plasman (maroon camp sites).

The hope, in making this history and others like it widely accessible to the public, is to encourage scholarly research and writing, and to encourage the general public to engage in relevant discussions, undertake activities, visit the sacred maroon sites, and be involved in other manifestations to commemorate this historical period of struggle for freedom and dignity.
